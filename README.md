# Python_Project
The aim of this project is to analyse Fisher's Iris dataset using Python. The iris dataset is a collection of observations of the dimensions of three Iris species - namely the length and width of sepals and petals.  It is a multivariate dataset, which makes it very suitable for analysis using Python. It contains 50 multivariate observations for each of the three species i.e. 
(Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor)

	1. The dataset was downloaded as a .csv file, which is a comma separated values file

Project Plan:
02 - 08 April
	- Research Python packages for use in analysing the dataset.
     -     Create a Python script to begin analysis of the dataset
     -     Research the background of the dataset

09 - 15 April
    - Visualize the dataset using the appropriate packages.
    -  Adapt and develop code to further analyse the dataset
   -  Write a summary of the analyses
   - Include notes and comments to demonstrate development process.

15-29 April
  - improve the code and expand analyses
  - Add findings and conclusion
